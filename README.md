# Project Euler

Solving Project Euler problems in various programming languages such as Rust, C++, or Python!

Project Euler website: <https://projecteuler.net>

## Setup

- If using Rust, install it! At least version 1.44 is required.

<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>

- If using Python, install it! At least version 3.8 is required.

<https://www.python.org/downloads/>

- If using C++, install g++ or some compiler! A fairly recent version of C++ is required.

Compiler g++ is often pre-installed on operating systems. But if any issue, Google how to do it :)

## Usage

Run a problem by specifying its number (e.g., 1) and its file (e.g., v1.rs):

```
make run PROBLEM=1 FILE=v1.rs
```

If supported, optimized runs are also available with:

```
make optimized-run PROBLEM=1 FILE=v1.rs
```
